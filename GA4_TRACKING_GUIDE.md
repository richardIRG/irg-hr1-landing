## Testing Events in Development

1. Open browser console (F12)

4. Verify events fire at appropriate times

## URL Parameters for Campaign Tracking

Add these to your URLs shared during webinar:
```
?utm_source=webinar&utm_medium=presentation&utm_campaign=wednesday_demo
```

These will be automatically tracked in the `campaign_landing` event.

## Notes for Presentation

- Events have monetary values assigned:
  - Whitepaper download: $100
  - Booking confirmation: $500
- Social proof counter (1-3 calls) is randomized per session
- All sensitive data is anonymized (anonymize_ip: true)
- Scroll and time tracking only fires once per threshold

## Troubleshooting

If events aren't showing in GA4:
1. Check that NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID is set in .env.local
2. Verify GA4 property is receiving data (may take 24-48 hours initially)
3. Check browser console for "ðŸ“Š GA4 Event:" logs in development
4. Ensure ad blockers aren't preventing GA4 script from loading
